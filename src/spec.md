# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the ZIKOLN portfolio’s hero/about copy and identity strings, and increase pink/magenta accents while keeping the existing futuristic neon look.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Hero section copy to prominently display “ZIKOLN” and the title “Graphic Designer” in clear English.
- Rewrite/clean the About bio to include: 1+ years of experience, creativity and attention to detail, specialties (Logos & Branding, Typography, Social Media Design, Motion Graphics), and mastery of Adobe Creative Suite; remove duplicated/awkward phrasing.
- Replace any placeholder personal name throughout the UI with “ZIKOLN”, including updating `frontend/src/content/siteConfig.ts` and the footer copyright line.
- Adjust global styling to introduce more visible pink/magenta accents in key highlights (e.g., headline/section gradients and at least one core component accent) without harming readability/contrast and respecting reduced-motion behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** The site reads as ZIKOLN’s portfolio with polished English hero/about text, correct naming across the UI (including the footer), and a more noticeably pink-accented neon futuristic theme.
