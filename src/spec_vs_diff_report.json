One acceptance criterion (ensuring no placeholder name appears anywhere else) cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "The diff shows `siteConfig.ts` and `FooterSection.tsx` updated to “ZIKOLN”, but the summary does not include evidence of searching/updating any other components/content that might still render the old placeholder name, so this AC cannot be verified from the provided changes alone.",
