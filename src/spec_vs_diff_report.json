  "summary": "Diff primarily addresses click-interactivity by ensuring decorative/background layers do not capture pointer events (GlobalBackground and Hero decorative layers) and by placing main content above them (z-index/pointer-events in App). However, the requested dev-only debug aid is not present, and there is a new user-facing emoji in a toast message that was not requested and may violate the English-only constraint.",

      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Add a minimal in-app debug aid for this specific issue: when running in development mode, provide an easy way to verify click handling is working (gated to development only) and remove/disable it for production builds.",
      "reason": "No evidence in the diff summary of any development-only click test UI element, conditional console logging gated by development mode, or similar debug aid. Changes focus on pointer-events/z-index only.",
